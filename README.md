# Welcome to the Crystal Collector

Here is how the game works. At the beginning of the game a random number will be given. Each one of the four crystals at the bottom have a random value; by clicking on the crystals you will add a specific number to your total score. The value of crystals will be hidden until it has been clicked. You win the game by matching your score to the random number, you lose if you exceed the random number. In each new game, the random number and the value of the crystals is different.
