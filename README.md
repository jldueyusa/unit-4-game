# Welcome to the Crystal Collector

Here is how the game works. There are 4 crystals that have random numbers attached to them which change each time the game starts over. The player is given a random number to meet. The player clicks on the crystals where the score adds each number to the value. If the player hits the random number they were given exactly, the player wins. If the player goes over, they lose.
